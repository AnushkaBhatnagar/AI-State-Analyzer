# AI State Analyzer

A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing, recording, and debugging state machines in web applications. This project combines state machine analysis with automated interaction recording using Playwright.

## Features

### 🎯 State Machine Analysis
- Automatically analyze HTML/JavaScript for state machine patterns
- Generate state schemas and visualizations
- Create debug panels for real-time state inspection

### 🎬 Playwright Session Recorder
- Record user interactions automatically
- Replay sessions with precise timing
- Convert recordings to reusable test scripts
- Test code changes with recorded interactions

### 🔍 Debug Tools
- Visual state panel overlay
- Live event tracking
- Session management and analysis

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install playwright flask

# Install Playwright browsers (one-time setup)
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the local web server
python server.py

# Server runs at http://localhost:8000
```

### Recording a Session

```bash
cd playwright_recorder
python record_session.py --html ../index.html
```

Browser opens → Interact with app → Press Ctrl+S to save → Recording saved to `recordings/` folder

### Replaying a Session

```bash
python replay_session.py --recording recordings/session_001.json
```

## Common Commands

### State Analysis
```bash
# Analyze state machine
python state_analyzer.py index.html

# Generate debug panel
python generate_state_panel.py index.html
```

### Recording & Replay
```bash
# Record session
cd playwright_recorder
python record_session.py --html ../index.html

# Replay at 2x speed
python replay_session.py --recording recordings/session_001.json --speed 2.0

# Convert to reusable script
python convert_to_script.py --recording recordings/session_001.json --output actions.json
```
